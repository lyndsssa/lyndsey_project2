## DESCRIPTION

This is a full-stack web application that allows user to view Instagram Worthy pool floats with the price. When user clicks the image the description when clicked. Ability to read blog, add your own float story & remove it. User can create their own pool float. Option to edit their recent order & update.

## Technologies used
INSTAGRAM pool floats app was built using Node.js, Express, Javascript, jQuery, Mongoose, bootstrap, CSS.

## Approach Taken
My inspiration for this app came from the idea of being able to purchase pool floats and be able to design your own. I thought it would be a great idea to not only be able to shop and easily find "Instagram Worthy Pool Floats" but to create your own all in one site. When I began this project I designed my project to have a shopping cart function and be able to add as many items to the car including the custom order. I ended up spending way to much time trying to make the cart work and eventually realized I need to do something else. I then changed my vision to have a blog instead of a shopping cart to meet the requirements of MVP. On the blog, users can read about why I started this website, share other peoples float stories and add their own float story.
Once I got my new vision I finished creating the routes. I did not have a lot of time to style my site and add in more functionality.

## Using the App
The navigation bar was created to help the user navigate around the site more easily. It gives a user the ability to the blog, store, and create your own float. The images displayed on the index page are rendered from the database I created.

## Unsolved Problems

When I decided to skip the cart idea it was Tuesday morning and I struggled getting all of my new routes to work properly to complete the mvp in time. Saying that I did not finish styling most of my app. If I had more time I would style everything more, add a option to add images along with users blog post, and create a fully functioning cart with checkout.
